# DeepLearning

Advancements in the field of deep learning has opened new doors to various exciting things that can be don using Deep Learning techniques. Although there are a lot of libraries like Theano, TensorFlow, Keras, etc. which offers a great framework for developing deep learning models. Out of these `Kera` is the only library in which it is much more easier to develop deep learning models. The great thing about `Keras` is that it can use `Theano` or `TensorFlow` as your backend. For more details about keras, you can look at this [link](https://keras.io/)

## Requirements
The following packages are needed for running the notebooks provided in this repository.
* Anaconda (https://www.continuum.io/)
* Python3.4xx
* numpy
* scipy
* scikit-learn
* keras
* Jupter notebook
* Theano or Tensorflow (for backend)
* Matplotlib

In order to run the notebooks, just open up a terminal and type `jupyter notebook`. This will open up  Jupyter notebook app in your default browser. Navigate to the folder where you have saved the project and double click to run any notebook
